# EEGIO Package

The [*EEGIO*](https://mkoculak.github.io/EEGIO.jl/) package allows for loading and saving EEG data from most popular formats. It is configured to extend the FileIO interface for better discoverability and ease-of-use.

Right now, it supports following formats:
- [BDF](@ref) (load and save)
- [EEG](@ref) (load and save)
